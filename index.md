## About Me

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science at Duke University, fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Bhuwan Dhingra](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~bdhingra/), and previously advised by [Sam Wiseman](https://swiseman.github.io/) from 2021 to 2023.

Previously, I was an undergrad at Sharif University of Technology, advised by [Prof. Vincent Jug√©](http://igm.univ-mlv.fr/~juge/). 

I am broadly interested in interpretability and reasoning in multimodal large language models.
