## About Me

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science at Duke University, fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Bhuwan Dhingra](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~bdhingra/). My research centers on two primary areas:
- algorithmic reasoning, particularly understanding language models' ability to learn and execute algorithms.
- leveraging LLMs for science; a significant portion of my recent work involves extracting structured information from materials science literature.

Previously, I was an undergrad at Sharif University of Technology, advised by Prof. [Vincent Jug√©](http://igm.univ-mlv.fr/~juge/). My research focused on sorting algorithms.
